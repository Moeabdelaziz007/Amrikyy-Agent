## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Scout Operations

```javascript

const cursorManager = new EnhancedCursorManagerAgent({
  scoutEnabled: true,
  memoryEnabled: true
});
await cursorManager.initialize();

// Notify scout of user conversation
await cursorManager.notifyScoutOfConversation('user_123', 
  'I want to visit Tokyo for the cherry blossoms and culture', {
  source: 'telegram',
  sessionId: 'session_001'
});

// Get user's active offers
const userOffers = await cursorManager.getUserOffers('user_123');
console.log(`User has ${userOffers.offers.length} active offers`);

// Get scout metrics
const scoutMetrics = cursorManager.getScoutMetrics();
console.log(`Scout has generated ${scoutMetrics.metrics.offersGenerated} offers`);
```

### Advanced Scout Configuration

```javascript
// Configure scout with custom settings
const scoutAgent = new ProactiveScoutAgent(manager, {
  monitoringInterval: 3 * 60 * 1000, // 3 minutes
  offerGenerationInterval: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  maxOffersPerUser: 5,
  priceDropThreshold: 0.10, // 10% drop triggers offer
  interestThreshold: 2, // 2 mentions minimum
  notificationChannels: ['telegram', 'whatsapp', 'email']
});
```

### Integration with Existing Systems

```javascript
// Scout integrates with conversation system
app.post('/api/ai/chat', async (req, res) => {
  const { message, userId } = req.body;
  
  // Process AI chat normally
  const response = await aiService.chatCompletion(message, userId);
  
  // Notify scout of conversation for interest tracking
  await cursorManager.notifyScoutOfConversation(userId, message, {
    source: 'web',
    sessionId: req.session.id
  });
  
  res.json({ response });
});

// Scout integrates with Telegram bot
bot.on('message', async (msg) => {
  const userId = msg.from.id.toString();
  const message = msg.text;
  
  // Process message normally
  const response = await processTelegramMessage(msg);
  
  // Notify scout for interest tracking
  await cursorManager.notifyScoutOfConversation(userId, message, {
    source: 'telegram',
    chatId: msg.chat.id
  });
  
  bot.sendMessage(msg.chat.id, response);
