Task: Optimize performance of activate-claude.sh
Status: Completed
Assignee: Gemini

Description:
Optimized the script by replacing multiple `echo` commands with a single `cat << EOF` (here document). This reduces the number of command invocations and makes the script more concise and easier to maintain.
