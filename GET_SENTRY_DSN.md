# 🔍 How to Get Your Sentry DSN

You've provided your Sentry organization details:

- **Organization Slug**: `aaas-6y`
- **Organization ID**: `4510171400634368`
- **Organization Name**: `AAAS`

Now we need your **Sentry DSN** to complete error tracking setup.

## 📋 Steps to Get Your Sentry DSN

### 1. **Create a Project** (If You Haven't Already)

Go to: https://sentry.io/organizations/aaas-6y/projects/

Click **"Create Project"**:

- **Platform**: Select `Node.js`
- **Project Name**: `amrikyy-backend`
- **Team**: Select your default team
- Click **"Create Project"**

### 2. **Get Your DSN**

After creating the project, you'll see a page with integration instructions.

Look for a line like this:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'https://abc123def456@o4510171400634368.ingest.sentry.io/7890123456',
  // ...
});
```

**That's your DSN!** It looks like:

```
https://[KEY]@o[ORG_ID].ingest.sentry.io/[PROJECT_ID]
```

### 3. **Or Find It Later**

If you already created a project:

1. Go to: https://sentry.io/organizations/aaas-6y/projects/
2. Click on your project name
3. Go to **Settings** → **Client Keys (DSN)**
4. Copy the **DSN** value

## 🔧 What Sentry Will Do for You

Once we add the DSN, Sentry will:

✅ **Catch All Errors**: Backend crashes, API failures, database errors
✅ **Real-Time Alerts**: Get notified instantly when errors occur
✅ **Stack Traces**: See exactly where and why errors happened
✅ **User Context**: Know which users were affected
✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Track slow API calls
✅ **Release Tracking**: See which deployment caused issues

## 💡 Quick Start (If You Want)

If you're in a hurry, you can:

1. Skip Sentry for now (app works without it!)
2. Add it later when you're ready to deploy
3. It's not blocking development

**Your choice, boss! What do you want to do?**

**Paste your Sentry DSN here when ready, or tell me if you want to skip it for now!** 🚀
