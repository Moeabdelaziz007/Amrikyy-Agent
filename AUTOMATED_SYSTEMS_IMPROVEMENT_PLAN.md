## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. Missing Dependencies
**Impact:** High - 4 test suites cannot run  
**Priority:** P0

#### Issues:
- `supertest` missing from backend devDependencies
- Required for all API integration tests
- Blocking: auth-enhanced.test.js, security.test.js, performance.test.js, error-scenarios.test.js

#### Solution:
```bash
npm install --save-dev supertest @types/supertest
```

### 2. Supabase Test Client Initialization Failure
**Impact:** Critical - 91 test failures  
**Priority:** P0

#### Root Cause:
- `testSupabaseClient` returns null due to environment checks
- Tests skip real database connection
- Missing or invalid SUPABASE_URL/SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

#### Solution Strategy:
```javascript
// Option A: Use test-specific env vars
TEST_SUPABASE_URL=<test_instance_url>
TEST_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<test_key>

// Option B: Mock Supabase client for unit tests
// Option C: Use local Supabase instance (recommended)
```

### 3. Missing Database Methods
**Impact:** High - 15+ test failures  
**Priority:** P0

#### Missing Methods in SupabaseDB class:
- `createUserProfile()`
- `createTravelOffer()`
- `getTravelOffers()`
- `saveUserPreference()`
- `trackOfferInteraction()`

#### Solution:
Implement missing CRUD operations in supabase.js

## üü° HIGH-PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS

### 4. Frontend Test Failures
**Impact:** Medium - UI/UX validation gaps  
**Priority:** P1

#### Issues:
a) **Playwright E2E Tests:** Wrong test context configuration
   - Error: test.describe() called in incorrect context
   - Files: auth.spec.ts, navigation.spec.ts
   
b) **Component Tests:** Outdated assertions
   - "Loading your travel assistant..." text not found
   - Form role attributes missing
   - "Maya Trips" branding text mismatch

#### Solution:
- Fix Playwright configuration (vitest vs playwright context)
- Update test assertions to match current UI
- Add proper ARIA roles to forms

### 5. Test Infrastructure Improvements
**Priority:** P1

#### Needed:
a) **Test Database Setup:**
   - Local Supabase instance with Docker
   - Automated schema migrations for tests
   - Seed data fixtures

b) **Test Isolation:**
   - Proper beforeEach/afterEach cleanup
   - Transaction rollbacks
   - Parallel test execution safety

c) **Test Performance:**
   - Reduce 28-second backend test time
   - Parallel test runners
   - Smart test selection
