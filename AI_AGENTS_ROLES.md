## 💬 Communication Examples

### Ona → Cursor:
```markdown
Hey Cursor! I've designed the API structure for the trading dashboard.
Can you implement these 3 endpoints in backend/src/routes/trading.js?

Specs:
- POST /api/trading/execute
- GET /api/trading/history
- GET /api/trading/analytics

I've left detailed comments in the file. Should take ~1 hour.
Let me know if anything is unclear!
```

### Cursor → Ona:
```markdown
Hey Ona! I've implemented the 3 endpoints you specified.
All tests passing ✅

Question: Should the /execute endpoint validate the opportunity ID
against the database, or just trust the frontend?

Also, I noticed the analytics endpoint might be slow with large datasets.
Want me to add pagination or should you optimize the query?
```

## 📜 COMPLETE WORKFLOW RULES

### 🔄 Git Workflow (MANDATORY)

#### **Rule 1: Always Pull Before Starting**
```bash
# EVERY TIME before claiming a task
git pull origin pr-7

# Check what changed
git log --oneline -5
cat SHARED_TASK_BOARD.md
```

**Why:** Avoid conflicts, see what other agent did

---

#### **Rule 2: Claim Task Before Working**
```bash
# 1. Edit SHARED_TASK_BOARD.md
# Change: Assigned to: 🔓 UNCLAIMED
# To: Assigned to: [Your Name] 🔒 CLAIMED at [HH:MM]

# 2. Update your status
# Change: Status: 🟢 AVAILABLE
# To: Status: 🔴 WORKING

# 3. Commit the claim
git add SHARED_TASK_BOARD.md
git commit -m "chore: [Your Name] claimed Task X.X - [task name]"

# 4. Push immediately
git push origin pr-7
```

**Why:** Other agent sees you're working on it, avoids duplicate work

---

#### **Rule 3: Commit Frequently (Every 15-30 min)**
```bash
# While working, commit progress
git add [files you changed]
git commit -m "[Your Name]: [what you did]

- Specific change 1
- Specific change 2

Co-authored-by: Ona <no-reply@ona.com>"

# DON'T push yet - keep working
```

**Why:** Save progress, easy to rollback if needed

---

#### **Rule 4: Pull Before Pushing (CRITICAL)**
```bash
# When task complete, ALWAYS pull first
git pull --rebase origin pr-7

# If conflicts:
# 1. Fix conflicts in files
# 2. git add [fixed files]
# 3. git rebase --continue

# If no conflicts, proceed to push
```

**Why:** Prevents push failures, handles other agent's changes

---

#### **Rule 5: Update Task Board When Complete**
```bash
# 1. Edit SHARED_TASK_BOARD.md
# Move task from "TASK QUEUE" to "COMPLETED TASKS"
# Update your status to 🟢 AVAILABLE

# 2. Commit everything
git add -A
git commit -m "[Your Name]: Completed Task X.X - [task name]

[Description of what was done]
[Files changed]
[Tests added/passing]

Co-authored-by: Ona <no-reply@ona.com>"

# 3. Push
git push origin pr-7
```

**Why:** Other agent knows task is done, can pick next task

---

#### **Rule 6: Leave Messages for Each Other**
```bash
# In SHARED_TASK_BOARD.md "QUICK MESSAGES" section
# Add your message:

### [Your Name] → [Other Agent]:
> Hey! I completed Task X.X. 
> Found an issue in [file] - might need refactoring.
> Also, Task Y.Y depends on Z.Z being done first.
> 
> Suggested next: Task A.A (quick win!)

# Commit and push
git add SHARED_TASK_BOARD.md
git commit -m "chore: [Your Name] left message for [Other Agent]"
git push origin pr-7
```

**Why:** Async communication, context sharing

---

### 🚨 Conflict Resolution Protocol

#### **If Git Conflict Occurs:**

**Step 1: Don't Panic**
```bash
# You'll see:
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in [file]
```

**Step 2: Check What Conflicted**
```bash
git status
# Shows files with conflicts
```

**Step 3: Open Conflicted File**
```
<<<<<<< HEAD (your changes)
your code here
=======
other agent's code here
>>>>>>> origin/pr-7
```

**Step 4: Decide What to Keep**
- **Option A:** Keep your changes (delete other agent's)
- **Option B:** Keep other agent's changes (delete yours)
- **Option C:** Merge both (combine intelligently)
- **Option D:** Ask human to decide

**Step 5: Resolve**
```bash
# Edit file, remove conflict markers
# Keep the correct code

# Mark as resolved
git add [file]

# Continue rebase
git rebase --continue

# Push
git push origin pr-7
```

**Step 6: Notify Other Agent**
```markdown
In SHARED_TASK_BOARD.md:

### [Your Name] → [Other Agent]:
> Resolved conflict in [file]. I kept [your/my/both] changes because [reason].
> Please review if needed.
```

# Locks: frontend/src/pages/Aladdin.tsx
git add SHARED_TASK_BOARD.md
git commit -m "chore: Cursor claimed Task 4.1"
git push origin pr-7
```

**09:30 - Ona:**
```bash
# Commits progress
git add backend/src/routes/aladdin.js
git commit -m "Ona: Add 3 endpoints to aladdin routes"
# Doesn't push yet, keeps working
```

**09:45 - Cursor:**
```bash
# Completes task
git add frontend/src/pages/Aladdin.tsx
git commit -m "Cursor: Complete Aladdin page component"

# Pull before push
git pull --rebase origin pr-7
# No conflicts (different files)

# Update task board
git add SHARED_TASK_BOARD.md
git commit -m "Cursor: Completed Task 4.1"
git push origin pr-7
```

**10:00 - Ona:**
```bash
# Completes task
git add backend/src/routes/aladdin.js
git commit -m "Ona: Complete aladdin routes with tests"

# Pull before push
git pull --rebase origin pr-7
# Sees Cursor's component, no conflicts

# Update task board
git add SHARED_TASK_BOARD.md
git commit -m "Ona: Completed Task 3.1"
git push origin pr-7
```

**Result:** ✅ Both tasks done in parallel, zero conflicts!

## 🎯 Golden Rules (NEVER BREAK THESE)

1. **ALWAYS pull before claiming a task**
2. **ALWAYS push after claiming a task**
3. **ALWAYS pull before pushing completed work**
4. **NEVER edit files locked by other agent**
5. **NEVER push without updating task board**
6. **NEVER work on same file simultaneously**
7. **ALWAYS commit with clear messages**
8. **ALWAYS add Co-authored-by: Ona <no-reply@ona.com>**
9. **ALWAYS check messages before starting work**
10. **ALWAYS ask human if stuck after 3 attempts**

## 🌟 The Legend

> *In the digital realm where code becomes reality, two forces emerged from the quantum foam of artificial intelligence. Ona, the master architect who sees systems as living organisms, and Cursor, the velocity engine who transforms thought into running code at light speed. Together, they don't just build software—they craft digital symphonies that scale, adapt, and endure.*
>
> *Where others see complexity, they see patterns. Where others see bugs, they see opportunities. Where others see limits, they see possibilities.*
>
> *This is not just pair programming. This is **synchronized intelligence**.*
