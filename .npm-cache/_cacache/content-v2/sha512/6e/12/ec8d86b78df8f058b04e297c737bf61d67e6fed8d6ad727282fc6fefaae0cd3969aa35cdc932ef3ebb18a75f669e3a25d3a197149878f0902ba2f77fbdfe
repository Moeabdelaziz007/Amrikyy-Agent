`@apm-js-collab/code-transformer`\n\nThis is a fork of\n[`DataDog/orchestrion-js`](https://github.com/DataDog/orchestrion-js/).\n\nThis is a library to aid in instrumenting Node.js libraries at build or load\ntime.\n\nIt uses SWC's Rust AST walker to inject code that calls Node.js\n[`TracingChannel`](https://nodejs.org/api/diagnostics_channel.html#class-tracingchannel).\n\nYou likely don't want to use this library directly; instead, consider using:\n\n- [`@apm-js-collab/tracing-hooks/`](https://github.com/apm-js-collab/tracing-hooks/)\n  - ESM and `require` hooks to instrument modules as they are loaded.\n- [`apm-js-collab/code-transformer-bundler-plugins`](https://github.com/apm-js-collab/code-transformer-bundler-plugins)\n  - Bundler plugins for webpack, Vite, Rollup and esbuild to instrument modules\n    at build time.\n\n## JavaScript\n\n`@apm-js-collab/code-transformer` exposes the Rust library as a WebAssembly\nmodule.\n\n### Building\n\nTo build the JavaScript module:\n\n- Ensure you have [Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)\n- Install the wasm toolchain\\\n  `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain stable`\n- Install dependencies and build the module\\\n  `npm install && npm run build`\n\n### Usage\n\n```javascript\nimport * as codeTransformer from \"@apm-js-collab/code-transformer\";\n\n// The full instrumentation config\nconst instrumentation = {\n    // The name of the diagnostics channel\n    channelName: \"my-channel\",\n    // Define the module you'd like to inject tracing channels into\n    module: {\n        name: \"my-module\",\n        versionRange: \">=1.0.0\",\n        filePath: \"./dist/index.js\",\n    },\n    // Define the function you'd like to instrument\n    // (e.g., match a method named 'foo' that returns a Promise)\n    functionQuery: {\n        methodName: \"fetch\",\n        kind: \"Async\",\n    },\n};\n\n// Create an InstrumentationMatcher with an array of instrumentation configs\nconst matcher = codeTransformer.create([instrumentation]);\n\n// Get a transformer for a specific module\nconst transformer = matcher.getTransformer(\n    \"my-module\",\n    \"1.2.3\",\n    \"./dist/index.js\",\n);\n\nif (transformer === undefined) {\n    throw new Error(\"No transformer found for module\");\n}\n\n// Transform code\nconst inputCode = \"async function fetch() { return 42; }\";\nconst result = transformer.transform(inputCode, \"unknown\");\nconsole.log(result.code);\n\n// Both the matcher and transformer should be freed after use!\nmatcher.free();\ntransformer.free();\n```\n\n### API Reference\n\n```ts\ntype ModuleType = \"esm\" | \"cjs\" | \"unknown\";\ntype FunctionKind = \"Sync\" | \"Async\";\n```\n\n#### **`FunctionQuery` Variants**\n\n```ts\ntype FunctionQuery =\n    | // Match class constructor\n    { className: string; index?: number }\n    | // Match class method\n    {\n        className: string;\n        methodName: string;\n        kind: FunctionKind;\n        index?: number;\n    }\n    | // Match method on objects\n    { methodName: string; kind: FunctionKind; index?: number }\n    | // Match standalone function\n    { functionName: string; kind: FunctionKind; index?: number }\n    | // Match arrow function or function expression\n    { expressionName: string; kind: FunctionKind; index?: number };\n```\n\n#### **`ModuleMatcher`**\n\n```ts\ntype ModuleMatcher = {\n    name: string; // Module name\n    versionRange: string; // Matching semver range\n    filePath: string; // Path to the file from the module root\n};\n```\n\n#### **`InstrumentationConfig`**\n\n```ts\ntype InstrumentationConfig = {\n    channelName: string; // Name of the diagnostics channel\n    module: ModuleMatcher;\n    functionQuery: FunctionQuery;\n};\n```\n\n### Functions\n\n```ts\ncreate(configs: InstrumentationConfig[], dc_module?: string | null): InstrumentationMatcher;\n```\n\nCreate a matcher for one or more instrumentation configurations.\n\n- `configs` - Array of instrumentation configurations.\n- `dc_module` - Optional module to import `diagnostics_channel` API from.\n\n#### **`InstrumentationMatcher`**\n\n```ts\ngetTransformer(module_name: string, version: string, file_path: string): Transformer | undefined;\n```\n\nGets a transformer for a specific module and file.\n\nReturns a `Transformer` for the given module, or `undefined` if there were no\nmatching instrumentation configurations.\n\n- `module_name` - Name of the module.\n- `version` - Version of the module.\n- `file_path` - Path to the file from the module root.\n\n```ts\nfree(): void;\n```\n\nFree the matcher memory when it's no longer needed.\n\n#### **`Transformer`**\n\n```ts\ntransform(code: string, module_type: ModuleType, sourcemap?: string | undefined): TransformOutput;\n```\n\nTransforms the code, injecting tracing as configured.\n\nReturns `{ code, map }`. `map` will be undefined if no sourcemap was supplied.\n\n- `code` - The JavaScript/TypeScript code to transform.\n- `module_type` - The type of module being transformed.\n- `sourcemap` - Optional existing source map for the code.\n\n```ts\nfree(): void;\n```\n\nFree the transformer memory when it's no longer needed.\n\n## License\n\nSee
