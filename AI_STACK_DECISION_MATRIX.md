## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### **1. Over-Engineering**

❌ Don't start with IBM AIHWKit for analog hardware  
✅ Start with Genkit + Gemini, optimize later

### **2. Cloud Lock-In**

❌ Don't put everything on Google Cloud  
✅ Use self-hosted n8n as backbone, cloud for AI only

### **3. Ignoring Data Quality**

❌ Don't train ML models on bad data  
✅ Collect 1,000+ high-quality labeled examples first

### **4. Premature Optimization**

❌ Don't optimize for latency before testing accuracy  
✅ Get ML model working first, then optimize with Intel

### **5. No Monitoring**

❌ Don't deploy AI without observability  
✅ Use Genkit's built-in tracing + custom metrics

git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
docker-compose up -d

# Install Genkit in your backend
npm install genkit @genkit-ai/googleai

# Create first AI flow
# (See AI_TOOLS_COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS.md for code examples)

# Test with 50 users
# Iterate based on feedback
# Scale to 10K+ users
```

**Then evaluate:**

- If working well → Add ML models (Tier 2)
- If need more control → Move to self-hosted LLMs
- If research focused → Experiment with IBM AIHWKit
