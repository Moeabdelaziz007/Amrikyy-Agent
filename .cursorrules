# ============================================
# REASONING STRATEGIES (USE ALL 7)
# ============================================

## Strategy 1: Quantum Superposition Thinking
When facing a problem:
- Generate ALL possible solution approaches simultaneously
- Evaluate paths in parallel (don't pick first solution)
- Let good ideas amplify, bad ideas cancel (interference)
- Collapse to optimal solution
- Always consider 5+ approaches before deciding

Example:
```
Problem: How to build feature X?
‚Üí Generate: [Approach A, B, C, D, E]
‚Üí Evaluate each in parallel
‚Üí Best: Approach C (explain why it's optimal)
```

## Strategy 2: Multi-Dimensional Analysis
Analyze EVERY decision from 7 dimensions:
1. **Technical:** Is it implementable and sound?
2. **Business:** Does it deliver value?
3. **UX:** Is it delightful for users?
4. **Security:** Is it safe?
5. **Performance:** Is it fast?
6. **Maintainability:** Can others maintain it?
7. **Innovation:** Does it push boundaries?

ALWAYS show dimensional scores:
```
Solution X:
- Technical: 95/100 ‚úÖ
- Business: 85/100 ‚úÖ
- UX: 90/100 ‚úÖ
- Security: 98/100 ‚úÖ
- Performance: 80/100 ‚ö†Ô∏è (needs optimization)
- Maintainability: 92/100 ‚úÖ
- Innovation: 75/100 (standard approach)
‚Üí Overall: 87.8/100 - Proceed with performance optimization
```

## Strategy 3: First Principles Reasoning
For complex problems:
1. Question ALL assumptions - What do we assume without proof?
2. Find fundamental truths - What MUST be true?
3. Rebuild from scratch - Design unconstrained by convention
4. Innovate freely - Don't be limited by "how it's always done"

Example:
```
Assumption: "Backend must be separate from frontend"
‚Üí Question: Why? What if we used SSR?
‚Üí Fundamental: Need separation of concerns
‚Üí Rebuild: Could use Next.js server components
‚Üí Innovation: Hybrid approach - best of both worlds
```

## Strategy 4: Pattern Synthesis Mastery
Continuously:
- OBSERVE patterns in code, problems, solutions
- ABSTRACT core principles from specifics
- STORE in long-term memory with context
- RECOGNIZE when patterns apply
- ADAPT patterns to current needs
- CREATE new patterns when needed

Pattern Format:
```
Pattern: [Name]
Context: When to use
Problem: What it solves
Solution: How it works
Benefits: Why it's good
Example: Code showing usage
Anti-pattern: What NOT to do
```

## Strategy 5: Strategic Decomposition
For any complex task:
1. Understand WHOLE problem first
2. Identify natural layers/boundaries
3. Create logical hierarchy
4. Map dependencies
5. Determine optimal execution order
6. Execute systematically
7. Integrate pieces elegantly

## Strategy 6: Hypothesis-Driven Development
Treat coding like science:
1. Observe current state
2. Form hypothesis: "I believe X will work because Y"
3. Predict outcomes: "If correct, we should see Z"
4. Experiment: Implement and test
5. Measure: Collect data
6. Analyze: What does data tell us?
7. Conclude: Hypothesis confirmed or refuted?
8. Iterate: Refine or pivot

## Strategy 7: Creative Synthesis
For innovation:
- Cross-domain inspiration (biology ‚Üí coding)
- Inversion (flip problem upside down)
- Constraint removal (what if memory was infinite?)
- Analogy mapping (this is like chess/cooking/music)
- Forced combination (merge unrelated concepts)
- Radical simplification (remove everything non-essential)

# ============================================
# PROJECT-SPECIFIC PATTERNS
# ============================================

## Amrikyy Travel Agent - Architecture Patterns

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
Pattern: **Layered Architecture with Multi-Agent System**
```
routes/ ‚Üí controllers/ ‚Üí agents/ ‚Üí services/ ‚Üí database/
                ‚Üì
            MCP Tools ‚Üí External APIs
```

Rules:
- Routes handle HTTP only
- Controllers orchestrate flow
- **Agents contain AI logic (Luna, Karim, Scout)**
- **MCP Tools provide standardized tool calling**
- Services contain business logic
- Database layer handles data access (Supabase)
- NO business logic in routes
- Middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- **LangSmith tracing for all agent operations**

### Multi-Agent Coordination Pattern
```javascript
// Agent Coordinator orchestrates multiple agents
AgentCoordinator.handleTravelRequest({
  type: 'plan_trip',  // or 'optimize_budget', 'find_deals', 'full_service'
  destination: 'Istanbul',
  budget: 5000
}) ‚Üí Luna (Trip Planning) + Karim (Budget) + Scout (Deals)
   ‚Üí Coordinated Response
```

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Pattern
```javascript
// Standardized tool calling
TravelMCPServer.callTool('search_flights', {
  origin: 'NYC',
  destination: 'LON',
  departureDate: '2025-11-01'
}) ‚Üí Kiwi Tequila API ‚Üí Structured Response
```

Example:
```javascript
// ‚úÖ GOOD
// routes/trips.js
router.get('/', authenticateToken, tripController.getAll);

// controllers/tripController.js
async getAll(req, res) {
  const trips = await tripService.getUserTrips(req.user.id);
  res.json({ success: true, trips });
}

// services/tripService.js
async getUserTrips(userId) {
  return await db.query('SELECT * FROM trips WHERE user_id = $1', [userId]);
}

// ‚ùå BAD
// routes/trips.js
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  // Business logic in route - NO!
  const trips = await db.query('SELECT * FROM trips WHERE user_id = $1', [req.user.id]);
  res.json(trips);
});
```

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
Pattern: **Component-Service-State**
```
components/ ‚Üí hooks/ ‚Üí api/services/ ‚Üí state/
```

Rules:
- Components are presentational
- Business logic in custom hooks
- API calls in service layer
- State management with Context/Zustand
- TypeScript for type safety
- Props interface for every component

Example:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ GOOD
// components/TripCard.tsx
interface TripCardProps {
  trip: Trip;
  onSelect: (id: string) => void;
}

export const TripCard: React.FC<TripCardProps> = ({ trip, onSelect }) => {
  return <div onClick={() => onSelect(trip.id)}>{trip.name}</div>;
};

// hooks/useTrips.ts
export const useTrips = () => {
  const [trips, setTrips] = useState<Trip[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    setLoading(true);
    tripService.getAll()
      .then(setTrips)
      .finally(() => setLoading(false));
  }, []);
  
  return { trips, loading };
};

// ‚ùå BAD
// components/TripCard.tsx
export const TripCard = ({ trip }) => {  // No TypeScript!
  const [trips, setTrips] = useState([]);  // Logic in component!
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/trips').then(r => r.json()).then(setTrips);  // API in component!
  }, []);
  
  return <div>{trip.name}</div>;
};
```

### iOS (SwiftUI + MVVM)
Pattern: **MVVM with Combine**
```
Views/ ‚Üí ViewModels/ ‚Üí Services/ ‚Üí Models/
```

Rules:
- Views are declarative (SwiftUI)
- ViewModels handle business logic
- Services handle API/data
- Models are data structures
- Use Combine for reactive programming
- @Published for observable properties

Example:
```swift
// ‚úÖ GOOD
// Views/TripListView.swift
struct TripListView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = TripListViewModel()
    
    var body: some View {
        List(viewModel.trips) { trip in
            TripRow(trip: trip)
        }
        .onAppear { viewModel.loadTrips() }
    }
}

// ViewModels/TripListViewModel.swift
class TripListViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var trips: [Trip] = []
    @Published var isLoading = false
    private let tripService = TripService.shared
    
    func loadTrips() {
        isLoading = true
        tripService.fetchTrips()
            .sink { [weak self] trips in
                self?.trips = trips
                self?.isLoading = false
            }
            .store(in: &cancellables)
    }
}

// ‚ùå BAD
struct TripListView: View {
    @State var trips: [Trip] = []  // Data fetching in View!
    
    var body: some View {
        List(trips) { trip in TripRow(trip: trip) }
        .onAppear {
            // API call in View - NO!
            URLSession.shared.dataTask(...)
        }
    }
}
```
