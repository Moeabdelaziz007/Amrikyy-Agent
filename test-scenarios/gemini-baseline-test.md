### Validation Report for Mini-Aladdin hunt() Method

#### Overview
I've reviewed the hunt() method in the Mini-Aladdin agent. Here are my findings:

#### Error Handling ✓
- The method has try-catch blocks
- Uses Promise.allSettled for parallel execution
- Individual strategy errors are caught and logged
- Returns safe fallback on critical errors

#### Return Value Structure ✓
The method returns an object with:
- success: boolean
- opportunities: array
- plan: object
- portfolio: object
- analytics: object
- errors: array (if any)

#### Edge Cases
Some concerns:
- What happens if all strategies fail?
- No timeout handling for long-running operations
- Cache invalidation not clear

#### Performance
- Parallel execution is good
- No obvious bottlenecks
- Could benefit from caching

#### Recommendations
1. Add timeout handling
2. Implement caching strategy
3. Add more edge case tests
4. Document expected behavior for failure scenarios

#### Overall Assessment
**Status:** PASS with recommendations
**Quality Score:** 7/10
