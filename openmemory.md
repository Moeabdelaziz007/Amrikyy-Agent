## Architecture

### System Design
The project follows a **client-server architecture** with clear separation between frontend and backend:

1. **Frontend Layer** (Port 3000)
   - React SPA with TypeScript
   - Communicates with backend via REST APIs
   - Handles UI/UX, authentication flow, and Telegram WebApp integration
   - Uses Supabase client for real-time features

2. **Backend Layer** (Port 5000)
   - Express REST API server
   - Handles business logic, AI interactions, and database operations
   - Manages Telegram Bot webhook and Mini App requests
   - Processes payments via Stripe/PayPal webhooks
   - Integrates with Z.ai for AI-powered recommendations

3. **Database Layer** (Supabase PostgreSQL)
   - Enhanced schema with comprehensive user profiling
   - Tables: users, trips, destinations, conversations, user_interests, user_dislikes, expenses, payments, halal_restaurants, prayer_locations, etc.
   - Row Level Security (RLS) enabled for data protection
   - Automated triggers for user activity tracking

4. **External Services**
   - **Z.ai GLM-4.6**: Chinese AI model for conversational intelligence
   - **Telegram**: Bot API + Mini App for mobile experience
   - **Stripe/PayPal**: Payment processing
   - **Supabase**: Authentication, database, real-time subscriptions

### Technology Choices
- **Why React + TypeScript**: Type safety, modern development experience, extensive ecosystem
- **Why Vite**: Fast HMR, optimized builds, better DX than Create React App
- **Why Supabase**: Open-source Firebase alternative, PostgreSQL-based, built-in auth and real-time
- **Why Z.ai GLM-4.6**: Cost-effective Chinese AI model with good Arabic support for Saudi market
- **Why Telegram**: Popular in Middle East, built-in payment support, Mini Apps for seamless UX
- **Why Monorepo**: Frontend + Backend in one repo for easier development and deployment

- Local state with `useState` for component-specific data
- React Hook Form for complex form state
- Supabase real-time subscriptions for live data updates

### Authentication Pattern
- Supabase Auth for user management
- JWT tokens stored in localStorage
- Protected routes with AuthProvider
- Automatic token refresh
- Support for email/password and OAuth providers

### Error Handling Pattern
- ErrorBoundary component at app root

### Testing Pattern
- **Vitest** for unit tests (React Testing Library)
- **Playwright** for e2e tests
- Test files in `__tests__` directories or `tests/e2e/`
- Mock Supabase and external APIs in tests
- Accessibility testing with `@playwright/test`

### AI Integration Pattern
