# Revert Recommendations for Automated Changes

## Scenario 1: Reverting a merged Pull Request
If an automated PR from the agent has been merged into the main branch, use `git revert`. This creates a new commit that undoes the changes.

```bash
# Find the merge commit SHA from the PR
MERGE_COMMIT_SHA="<sha-of-merge-commit>"

# Execute the revert command. --no-edit uses the default message.
git revert --no-edit $MERGE_COMMIT_SHA
```

## Scenario 2: Deleting an unmerged branch from an agent PR
If the PR has not been merged, you can simply close the PR and delete the remote branch.

```bash
# The branch name is typically in the format bot/auto-update-agent-<timestamp>
BRANCH_NAME="<agent-generated-branch-name>"

# Delete the remote branch
git push origin --delete $BRANCH_NAME
```
