## üßÆ 1. Topology Fundamentals

### What is Topology?

**Mathematical Definition**: Topology studies properties of shapes that are preserved under continuous deformations

**AIX v0.3 Definition**: The pattern of connections and relationships between agents that determines how information, energy, and tasks flow through the system.
