STOP! Cancel this task.

We want to keep the ORIGINAL 6 Mini Apps that are already in the code:
- Luna (Trip Planner)
- Karim (Budget Optimizer)

- Maya (AI Assistant)

- Kody (Code Interpreter)

These apps are already defined in commit df14a88.

DO NOT create new apps. Use the existing 6 Mini Apps.
```

## 🔄 Alternative:

If you can't cancel, we'll manually revert the changes after preview is deployed.
