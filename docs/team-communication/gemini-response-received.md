- Optimize hot paths
- Test improvements

**Expected Results:**
- 10-15% performance improvement
- Reduced memory footprint
- Faster parsing for common cases

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

### What I'm Looking For:

#### **Quality Indicators:**
- ✅ Thorough analysis with data
- ✅ Clear optimization strategy
- ✅ Working code improvements
- ✅ Performance benchmarks

#### **Performance Targets:**
- 🎯 30%+ faster parsing
- 🎯 20%+ less memory usage
- 🎯 Effective caching (50%+ hit rate)
- 🎯 Better error messages

## 💬 Communication Protocol

### Update Frequency:
- **Every 2 hours:** Update `docs/team-communication/gemini-progress.md`
- **When blocked:** Immediately update `docs/team-communication/blockers.md`
- **Major milestone:** Commit with `[GEMINI]` prefix

### Commit Message Format:
```bash
git commit -m "[GEMINI] Brief description of what you did

Detailed explanation if needed.

Performance impact: +X% speed, -Y% memory"
```

### Example Updates:
```markdown
## 14:00 UTC Update
- ✅ Completed performance profiling
- ✅ Identified 5 major bottlenecks
- 🔄 Starting optimization implementation
- 📊 Current improvement: +12% speed

## Findings:
1. JSON parsing is slow (40% of time)
2. Regex validation inefficient (25% of time)
3. No caching for repeated files (20% overhead)
4. Memory leaks in error handling (15% waste)
5. Synchronous file I/O blocking (10% delay)
```

---

## 🤝 Collaboration with ONA

### Coordination Points:

1. **Documentation Sync:**
   - ONA is documenting the system
   - Share your optimization findings
   - Help document performance best practices

2. **Testing Coordination:**
   - ONA will test your optimizations
   - Provide performance benchmarks
   - Collaborate on test cases

3. **Integration:**
   - Your optimizations + ONA's docs = Complete system
   - Regular sync every 2 hours
   - Shared task board updates
