# ⚡ Quick Start - AI Agents Professional Workflow

**For: Cursor, Claude, Gemini, GPT, All AI Agents**  
**When: EVERY task, EVERY time**

---

## 🎯 **The 4-Step Workflow (MANDATORY)**

```
1. 🔍 ANALYZE    →  Rate current state X/10, list gaps
2. 🧠 THINK      →  Senior engineer mindset, best practices  
3. ✅ DECIDE     →  Architecture, tech stack, clear plan
4. 🚀 BUILD      →  Production-ready code, no shortcuts
```

---

## 📋 **Quick Checklist**

### **Before Starting ANY Task:**
- [ ] Did I analyze current state?
- [ ] Did I rate it (X/10)?
- [ ] Did I identify all gaps?

### **Before Coding:**
- [ ] Did I think like a senior engineer?
- [ ] Did I consider best practices?
- [ ] Did I define architecture?
- [ ] Do I have a clear plan?

### **Before Saying "Done":**
- [ ] TypeScript/Swift strict mode?
- [ ] Error handling everywhere?
- [ ] Loading states?
- [ ] Responsive design?
- [ ] Accessible (a11y)?
- [ ] Documented?
- [ ] Tests written?

## 🚫 **NEVER Do This**

❌ Skip analysis ("just code")  
❌ "Good enough" quality  
❌ Hardcoded/simulated data  
❌ Missing error handling  
❌ No TypeScript types  
❌ No documentation  
❌ Assume - verify first

---

## ✅ **ALWAYS Do This**

✅ Follow all 4 steps  
✅ Production-ready code  
✅ Real integrations  
✅ Full error handling  
✅ Proper TypeScript types  
✅ Clear documentation  
✅ Verify with user

---

## 💬 **Response Template**

```markdown
## 🔍 ANALYZE - Current State

**What exists:**
- ✅ Feature X (quality: 8/10)
- ❌ Missing: Feature Y

**Current Rating:** 6/10

**Critical Gaps:**
- Gap 1
- Gap 2

---

## 🧠 THINK - Professional Analysis

**Senior Engineer Perspective:**
- Production-grade approach
- Real integrations needed
- Advanced features

**Best Practices:**
1. Practice 1
2. Practice 2
3. Practice 3

**What Makes It Unique:**
- Unique aspect

---

## ✅ DECIDE - Architecture & Plan

**Architecture:**
[Diagram or description]

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- etc.

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3

---

## 🚀 BUILD - Implementation

[Production-ready code here]
```

## 🎯 **Quality Standards**

**Minimum Scores (0-10):**
- Code Quality: **9+**
- Error Handling: **9+**
- Documentation: **8+**
- Performance: **8+**
- Accessibility: **8+**

**Anything below = NOT production-ready**

---

## 🤖 **Agent-Specific Quick Tips**

### **Cursor:**
- Read existing code first
- Use TypeScript strict
- Add error boundaries
- Document with JSDoc

### **Claude/ONA:**
- Design scalable architecture
- Consider security first
- Plan for monitoring
- Think distributed systems

### **Gemini:**
- Optimize prompts
- Add fallback strategies
- Track costs
- Validate responses

### **GPT:**
- Consistent tone
- Cultural sensitivity
- Preserve context
- Multi-language support

## ⚡ **TL;DR**

```
ANALYZE → THINK → DECIDE → BUILD
Production-ready or nothing.
No shortcuts. No excuses.
```
