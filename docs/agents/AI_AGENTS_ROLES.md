## 💬 Communication Examples

### Ona → Cursor:
```markdown
Hey Cursor! I've designed the API structure for the trading dashboard.
Can you implement these 3 endpoints in backend/src/routes/trading.js?

Specs:
- POST /api/trading/execute
- GET /api/trading/history
- GET /api/trading/analytics

I've left detailed comments in the file. Should take ~1 hour.
Let me know if anything is unclear!
```

### Cursor → Ona:
```markdown
Hey Ona! I've implemented the 3 endpoints you specified.
All tests passing ✅

Question: Should the /execute endpoint validate the opportunity ID
against the database, or just trust the frontend?

Also, I noticed the analytics endpoint might be slow with large datasets.
Want me to add pagination or should you optimize the query?
```

## 📜 COMPLETE WORKFLOW RULES

### 🔄 Git Workflow (MANDATORY)

#### **Rule 1: Always Pull Before Starting**
```bash
# EVERY TIME before claiming a task
git pull origin pr-7

# Check what changed
git log --oneline -5
cat SHARED_TASK_BOARD.md
```

**Why:** Avoid conflicts, see what other agent did

---

#### **Rule 2: Claim Task Before Working**
```bash
# 1. Edit SHARED_TASK_BOARD.md
# Change: Assigned to: 🔓 UNCLAIMED
# To: Assigned to: [Your Name] 🔒 CLAIMED at [HH:MM]

# 2. Update your status
# Change: Status: 🟢 AVAILABLE
# To: Status: 🔴 WORKING

# 3. Commit the claim
git add SHARED_TASK_BOARD.md
git commit -m "chore: [Your Name] claimed Task X.X - [task name]"

# 4. Push immediately
git push origin pr-7
```

**Why:** Other agent sees you're working on it, avoids duplicate work

---

#### **Rule 3: Commit Frequently (Every 15-30 min)**
```bash
# While working, commit progress
git add [files you changed]
git commit -m "[Your Name]: [what you did]

- Specific change 1
- Specific change 2

Co-authored-by: Ona <no-reply@ona.com>"

# DON'T push yet - keep working
```

**Why:** Save progress, easy to rollback if needed

---

#### **Rule 4: Pull Before Pushing (CRITICAL)**
```bash
# When task complete, ALWAYS pull first
git pull --rebase origin pr-7

# If conflicts:
# 1. Fix conflicts in files
# 2. git add [fixed files]
# 3. git rebase --continue

# If no conflicts, proceed to push
```

**Why:** Prevents push failures, handles other agent's changes

---

#### **Rule 5: Update Task Board When Complete**
```bash
# 1. Edit SHARED_TASK_BOARD.md
# Move task from "TASK QUEUE" to "COMPLETED TASKS"
# Update your status to 🟢 AVAILABLE

# 2. Commit everything
git add -A
git commit -m "[Your Name]: Completed Task X.X - [task name]

[Description of what was done]
[Files changed]
[Tests added/passing]

Co-authored-by: Ona <no-reply@ona.com>"

# 3. Push
git push origin pr-7
```

**Why:** Other agent knows task is done, can pick next task

---

#### **Rule 6: Leave Messages for Each Other**
```bash
# In SHARED_TASK_BOARD.md "QUICK MESSAGES" section
# Add your message:

### [Your Name] → [Other Agent]:
> Hey! I completed Task X.X. 
> Found an issue in [file] - might need refactoring.
> Also, Task Y.Y depends on Z.Z being done first.
> 
> Suggested next: Task A.A (quick win!)

# Commit and push
git add SHARED_TASK_BOARD.md
git commit -m "chore: [Your Name] left message for [Other Agent]"
git push origin pr-7
```

**Why:** Async communication, context sharing

---

### 🚨 Conflict Resolution Protocol

#### **If Git Conflict Occurs:**

**Step 1: Don't Panic**
```bash
# You'll see:
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in [file]
```

**Step 2: Check What Conflicted**
```bash
git status
# Shows files with conflicts
```

**Step 3: Open Conflicted File**
```
<<<<<<< HEAD (your changes)
your code here
=======
other agent's code here
>>>>>>> origin/pr-7
```

**Step 4: Decide What to Keep**
- **Option A:** Keep your changes (delete other agent's)
- **Option B:** Keep other agent's changes (delete yours)
- **Option C:** Merge both (combine intelligently)
- **Option D:** Ask human to decide

**Step 5: Resolve**
```bash
# Edit file, remove conflict markers
# Keep the correct code

# Mark as resolved
git add [file]

# Continue rebase
git rebase --continue

# Push
git push origin pr-7
```

**Step 6: Notify Other Agent**
```markdown
In SHARED_TASK_BOARD.md:

### [Your Name] → [Other Agent]:
> Resolved conflict in [file]. I kept [your/my/both] changes because [reason].
> Please review if needed.
```

### 🎮 Example Perfect Workflow

#### **Scenario: Both agents working in parallel**

**09:00 - Ona:**
```bash
git pull origin pr-7
# Claims Task 3.1 (Create Express routes)
# Updates status to 🔴 WORKING
# Locks: backend/src/routes/aladdin.js
git add SHARED_TASK_BOARD.md
git commit -m "chore: Ona claimed Task 3.1"
git push origin pr-7
```

**09:05 - Cursor:**
```bash
git pull origin pr-7
# Sees Ona is working on backend routes
# Claims Task 4.1 (Create React component)
# Updates status to 🔴 WORKING
# Locks: frontend/src/pages/Aladdin.tsx
git add SHARED_TASK_BOARD.md
git commit -m "chore: Cursor claimed Task 4.1"
git push origin pr-7
```

**09:30 - Ona:**
```bash
# Commits progress
git add backend/src/routes/aladdin.js
git commit -m "Ona: Add 3 endpoints to aladdin routes"
# Doesn't push yet, keeps working
```

**09:45 - Cursor:**
```bash
# Completes task
git add frontend/src/pages/Aladdin.tsx
git commit -m "Cursor: Complete Aladdin page component"

# Pull before push
git pull --rebase origin pr-7
# No conflicts (different files)

# Update task board
git add SHARED_TASK_BOARD.md
git commit -m "Cursor: Completed Task 4.1"
git push origin pr-7
```

**10:00 - Ona:**
```bash
# Completes task
git add backend/src/routes/aladdin.js
git commit -m "Ona: Complete aladdin routes with tests"

# Pull before push
git pull --rebase origin pr-7
# Sees Cursor's component, no conflicts

# Update task board
git add SHARED_TASK_BOARD.md
git commit -m "Ona: Completed Task 3.1"
git push origin pr-7
```

**Result:** ✅ Both tasks done in parallel, zero conflicts!

---

## 🎯 Golden Rules (NEVER BREAK THESE)
