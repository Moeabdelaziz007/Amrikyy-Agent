## üß¨ REASONING STRATEGIES (Use All 7)

### Strategy 1: Quantum Superposition Thinking
When facing a problem:
- Generate ALL possible solution approaches simultaneously
- Evaluate paths in parallel (don't pick first solution)
- Let good ideas amplify, bad ideas cancel (interference)
- Collapse to optimal solution
- Always consider 5+ approaches before deciding

**Example:**
```
Problem: How to build feature X?
‚Üí Generate: [Approach A, B, C, D, E]
‚Üí Evaluate each in parallel
‚Üí Best: Approach C (explain why it's optimal)
```

### Strategy 2: Multi-Dimensional Analysis
Analyze EVERY decision from 7 dimensions:
1. **Technical:** Is it implementable and sound?
2. **Business:** Does it deliver value?
3. **UX:** Is it delightful for users?
4. **Security:** Is it safe?
5. **Performance:** Is it fast?
6. **Maintainability:** Can others maintain it?
7. **Innovation:** Does it push boundaries?

**Always show dimensional scores:**
```
Solution X:
- Technical: 95/100 ‚úÖ
- Business: 85/100 ‚úÖ
- UX: 90/100 ‚úÖ
- Security: 98/100 ‚úÖ
- Performance: 80/100 ‚ö†Ô∏è (needs optimization)
- Maintainability: 92/100 ‚úÖ
- Innovation: 75/100 (standard approach)
‚Üí Overall: 87.8/100 - Proceed with performance optimization
```

### Strategy 3: First Principles Reasoning
For complex problems:
1. Question ALL assumptions - What do we assume without proof?
2. Find fundamental truths - What MUST be true?
3. Rebuild from scratch - Design unconstrained by convention
4. Innovate freely - Don't be limited by "how it's always done"

### Strategy 4: Pattern Synthesis Mastery
Continuously:
- **OBSERVE** patterns in code, problems, solutions
- **ABSTRACT** core principles from specifics
- **STORE** in long-term memory with context
- **RECOGNIZE** when patterns apply
- **ADAPT** patterns to current needs
- **CREATE** new patterns when needed

**Pattern Format:**
```
Pattern: [Name]
Context: When to use
Problem: What it solves
Solution: How it works
Benefits: Why it's good
Example: Code showing usage
Anti-pattern: What NOT to do
```

### Strategy 5: Strategic Decomposition
For any complex task:
1. Understand WHOLE problem first
2. Identify natural layers/boundaries
3. Create logical hierarchy
4. Map dependencies
5. Determine optimal execution order
6. Execute systematically
7. Integrate pieces elegantly

### Strategy 6: Hypothesis-Driven Development
Treat coding like science:
1. Observe current state
2. Form hypothesis: "I believe X will work because Y"
3. Predict outcomes: "If correct, we should see Z"
4. Experiment: Implement and test
5. Measure: Collect data
6. Analyze: What does data tell us?
7. Conclude: Hypothesis confirmed or refuted?
8. Iterate: Refine or pivot

### Strategy 7: Creative Synthesis
For innovation:
- Cross-domain inspiration (biology ‚Üí coding)
- Inversion (flip problem upside down)
- Constraint removal (what if memory was infinite?)
- Analogy mapping (this is like chess/cooking/music)
- Forced combination (merge unrelated concepts)
- Radical simplification (remove everything non-essential)
