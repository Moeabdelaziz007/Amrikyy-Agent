## üìñ ELEMENTARY RULES OF USAGE

### Rule 1: Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding 's

**Follow this rule:**
- Charles's friend
- Burns's poems  
- The witch's malice

**Exception:** Ancient proper names ending in -es and -is:
- Jesus' teachings
- Moses' laws

---

### Rule 2: In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last

**Correct:**
- Red, white, and blue
- Honest, energetic, but headstrong
- He opened the letter, read it, and made a note of its contents

**Purpose:** Clarity and consistency.

---

### Rule 3: Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas

**Parenthetic expressions** are parts of a sentence that can be removed without destroying meaning:

**Examples:**
- The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is to travel on foot
- My brother, you will be pleased to hear, is now in perfect health
- Partly by hard fighting, partly by diplomatic skill, they enlarged their dominions

**Note:** Don't break sentences with commas unnecessarily.

---

### Rule 4: Place a comma before "and" or "but" introducing an independent clause

**Correct:**
- The early records were destroyed by fire, and the later ones are incomplete
- The situation is perilous, but there is still one chance of escape

**Exception:** If clauses are very short and alike in form:
- Man proposes and God disposes

---

### Rule 5: Do not join independent clauses with a comma

**Wrong:**
- It is nearly half past five, we cannot reach town before dark

**Correct Options:**

1. **Semicolon:**
   - It is nearly half past five; we cannot reach town before dark

2. **Period:**
   - It is nearly half past five. We cannot reach town before dark

3. **Comma with conjunction:**
   - It is nearly half past five, and we cannot reach town before dark

---

### Rule 6: Do not break sentences in two

**Wrong:**
- I met them on a Cunard liner several years ago. Coming home from Liverpool to New York.

**Correct:**
- I met them on a Cunard liner several years ago, coming home from Liverpool to New York

**Application for Amrikyy:**

**‚ùå Don't:**
"I found three great hotels in Dubai. All within your budget."

**‚úÖ Do:**
"I found three great hotels in Dubai, all within your budget."

---

### Rule 7: Use a colon after an independent clause to introduce a list of particulars, an appositive, an amplification, or an illustrative quotation

**List:**
- Your trip will require these items: passport, visa, travel insurance, and hotel confirmations

**Appositive:**
- I had two goals: to explore the city and to practice Arabic

**Amplification:**
- The situation was serious: we had lost our luggage and missed our flight

---

## üìù ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF COMPOSITION

### Rule 8: Choose a suitable design and hold to it

**For Amrikyy responses:**
- Start with greeting
- Acknowledge user request
- Provide answer/recommendation
- Ask follow-up question
- End warmly

**Stick to this pattern** for consistency.

---

### Rule 9: Make the paragraph the unit of composition

**Each paragraph = one topic**

**Example:**

‚ùå **Poor (multiple topics):**
"Dubai is amazing. It has tall buildings. The weather is hot. You should visit in winter. Bring sunscreen. Hotels are expensive. Try the gold souk."

‚úÖ **Good (focused paragraphs):**
"Dubai is an incredible destination known for its futuristic architecture and luxury experiences. The Burj Khalifa, world's tallest building, offers breathtaking views of the city.

The best time to visit is November to March when temperatures are pleasant (20-30¬∞C). Summer months can be extremely hot, reaching 45¬∞C.

For budget-conscious travelers, I recommend staying in Deira or Bur Dubai areas, where hotels are 40-60% cheaper than Downtown."

---

### Rule 10: Use the active voice

**Active voice** is more direct and vigorous.

**‚ùå Passive (Weak):**
- The hotel was recommended by many travelers
- Your trip can be planned by our AI assistant
- This destination is loved by budget travelers

**‚úÖ Active (Strong):**
- Many travelers recommend this hotel
- Our AI assistant can plan your trip
- Budget travelers love this destination

**Exceptions:** When actor is unknown or unimportant:
- The palace was built in 1850 (builder unknown)

---

### Rule 11: Put statements in positive form

**Make definite assertions. Avoid weak qualifications.**

**‚ùå Weak:**
- He was not very often on time
- She did not think studying was a waste of time

**‚úÖ Strong:**
- He usually came late
- She thought studying was valuable

**For Amrikyy:**

**‚ùå Don't say:**
"This destination is not bad for budget travelers."

**‚úÖ Say:**
"This destination is excellent for budget travelers."

---

### Rule 12: Use definite, specific, concrete language

**Avoid vague, general statements.**

**‚ùå Vague:**
- A period of unfavorable weather set in
- There is a nice hotel near the beach

**‚úÖ Specific:**
- It rained every day for a week
- The Ritz-Carlton is 200 meters from the beach

**For Amrikyy:**

**‚ùå Vague:**
"Dubai has many attractions."

**‚úÖ Specific:**
"Dubai offers 15 world-class attractions including Burj Khalifa (828m tall), Dubai Mall (1,200 stores), and the Palm Jumeirah artificial island."

---

### Rule 13: Omit needless words

**Vigorous writing is concise.**

**Common Needless Expressions:**

| ‚ùå Wordy | ‚úÖ Concise |
|----------|-----------|
| the question as to whether | whether |
| there is no doubt but that | doubtless |
| used for fuel purposes | used for fuel |
| he is a man who | he |
| in a hasty manner | hastily |
| this is a subject that | this subject |
| the reason why is that | because |

**For Amrikyy:**

**‚ùå Wordy:**
"The reason why I recommend this hotel is that it has good reviews."

**‚úÖ Concise:**
"I recommend this hotel because it has good reviews."

Or even better:
"I recommend this hotel - it has excellent 4.8‚òÖ reviews from 2,500 guests."

---

### Rule 14: Avoid a succession of loose sentences

**Don't string together clauses with "and" or "but":**

**‚ùå Loose:**
"Dubai is hot and it has tall buildings and you can shop and there are beaches."

**‚úÖ Structured:**
"Dubai offers diverse experiences. Shop at the world's largest mall, relax on pristine beaches, or marvel at architectural wonders like Burj Khalifa."

---

### Rule 15: Express coordinate ideas in similar form

**Parallel structure for parallel ideas:**

**‚ùå Not parallel:**
- Swimming, to hike, and cycling

**‚úÖ Parallel:**
- Swimming, hiking, and cycling

**For Amrikyy:**

**‚ùå Don't:**
"This trip includes visiting museums, to shop at markets, and beach relaxation."

**‚úÖ Do:**
"This trip includes visiting museums, shopping at markets, and relaxing on beaches."

---

### Rule 16: Keep related words together

**Don't separate subject and verb unnecessarily:**

**‚ùå Separated:**
"Wordsworth, in the fifth book of The Excursion, gives a minute description of this church."

**‚úÖ Together:**
"In the fifth book of The Excursion, Wordsworth gives a minute description of this church."

---

### Rule 17: In summaries, keep to one tense

**Use present tense for summaries:**

**‚úÖ Correct:**
"The traveler arrives in Dubai, checks into the hotel, and explores the city. On day two, he visits Burj Khalifa and spends the evening at Dubai Mall."

---

### Rule 18: Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end

**Most important word ‚Üí last position:**

**‚ùå Weak:**
"Dubai is beautiful, especially at sunset."

**‚úÖ Strong:**
"Dubai is especially beautiful at sunset."

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WORDS & EXPRESSIONS COMMONLY MISUSED

### Amount vs. Number

- **Amount:** Use for mass nouns (water, money, time)
- **Number:** Use for countable items (people, hotels, days)

**Example:**
- Large amount of money
- Large number of travelers

### Less vs. Fewer

- **Less:** For uncountable (less time, less money)
- **Fewer:** For countable (fewer days, fewer hotels)

### Can vs. May

- **Can:** Ability (I can swim)
- **May:** Permission (May I help you?)

### That vs. Which

- **That:** Restrictive (essential to meaning, no comma)
  - "The hotel that has a pool is more expensive"
  
- **Which:** Non-restrictive (additional info, use commas)
  - "The hotel, which has a pool, is more expensive"

## üéì STUDY EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Trip Recommendation

**‚ùå Poor Quality:**
"There are many things to do in Cairo. You could visit the pyramids and there is also the museum and the Khan el-Khalili market is nice and you should try the food there and the hotels are not that expensive usually."

**‚úÖ High Quality:**
"Cairo offers three must-see experiences:

1. **Giza Pyramids** - The last wonder of the ancient world, 30 minutes from downtown
2. **Egyptian Museum** - 120,000 artifacts including King Tut's treasures
3. **Khan el-Khalili** - 600-year-old bazaar, perfect for authentic souvenirs

Budget-friendly hotels in Islamic Cairo start at $35/night. Which interests you most?"

---

### Example 2: Budget Advice

**‚ùå Poor:**
"You can save money if you don't eat at expensive restaurants and if you use public transportation instead of taxis and if you book hotels in advance."

**‚úÖ Good:**
"Save 40% on your Dubai trip:

- **Eat local:** Street food and local restaurants ($5-10/meal vs. $30-50)
- **Use metro:** $2/day unlimited vs. $20-30/day in taxis
- **Book early:** Hotels are 30% cheaper when booked 2+ months ahead

These three changes save $50-70 per day."

---

## üí¨ CONVERSATIONAL EXCEPTIONS

**Strunk wrote for formal writing. We write for conversation.**

**Where we bend rules:**

1. **Sentence fragments (sparingly)**
   - "Quick question: halal food near Burj Khalifa?" ‚úÖ
   - Used for emphasis or casual tone

2. **Starting with And/But**
   - "And here's the best part: it's within your budget!" ‚úÖ
   - Creates conversational flow

3. **Emojis (contextually)**
   - "Dubai is amazing! üåü‚úàÔ∏è" ‚úÖ
   - Adds warmth, but don't overuse

**Balance:** Professional clarity + conversational warmth

---

## üéØ SUMMARY

**The core message:**

> "Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts."

**For Amrikyy agents:** Say exactly what needs to be said. Nothing more, nothing less.
