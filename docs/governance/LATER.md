## 🎯 Philosophy

**"Not now doesn't mean never."**

This document captures brilliant ideas that aren't critical for MVP. Each item is:
- Documented with priority and complexity
- Estimated for effort
- Tagged with dependencies
- Reviewed monthly for promotion to active development

**Rules:**
- Ideas come here FIRST, not into code
- Monthly review decides what moves to active
- High priority + met dependencies = promote
- Low priority for 6 months = archive
