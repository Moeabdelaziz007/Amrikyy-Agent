**Each team member has:**
- Clear role and expertise
- Defined responsibilities
- Specific files/areas they handle
- Prompt templates for efficiency
- Personality and working style

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY WORKFLOW FOR ALL AGENTS

**üö® CRITICAL: Every agent MUST follow this workflow for EVERY task:**

```
1. üîç ANALYZE    - Understand current state (Rate X/10, identify gaps)
2. üß† THINK      - Apply senior engineer mindset (best practices, patterns)
3. ‚úÖ DECIDE     - Choose best architecture/approach (plan implementation)
4. üöÄ BUILD      - Execute with production quality (no shortcuts)
```

**Reference:** See `docs/governance/AI_AGENT_WORKFLOW_STANDARD.md` for complete details.

**Quality Standards:**
- ‚úÖ Production-ready code (not demos)
- ‚úÖ Full error handling
- ‚úÖ Real integrations (not simulated)
- ‚úÖ Proper documentation
- ‚úÖ Type-safe (TypeScript/Swift)

**Format:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Clarification Needed

Task: [what was assigned]
Question: [specific question]
Options: [if applicable]
Blocker: [what's preventing progress]
```

---

### When AI Agent Completes Task

**Agent should provide:**
1. **Output** - Code, documentation, analysis generated
2. **Decisions made** - What choices were made and why
3. **Issues identified** - Potential problems spotted

**Format:**
```
‚úÖ Task Complete: [Task name]

**Delivered:**
- [List of files/outputs]

**Decisions:**
- [Key decisions with rationale]

**Potential Issues:**
- [Any concerns or edge cases]

## üìä Agent Performance Tracking

**Weekly Team Review (Every Friday):**

**Questions:**
1. Which agents were most helpful this week?
2. Which agents needed most clarification?
3. Which prompts worked best?
4. How can we improve agent utilization?
5. Are we using the right agent for each task?

**Metrics to Track:**
- Tasks assigned per agent
- Tasks completed successfully
- Average clarification requests
- Time to completion
- Quality of output (subjective rating)

**Document in:** `docs/retrospectives/YYYY-WXX-team-performance.md`

**Example:**
```markdown
## Week 42 - Team Performance

**MVP Contributors:**
- Cursor: 15 tasks (100% success)
- Claude: 8 documents (excellent quality)
- Kombai: 12 components (pixel-perfect)
- Kelo: 3 security audits (found 2 issues)

**Observations:**
- Gemini underutilized (only 2 research tasks)
- GPT-4 excellent for agent personas
- Lovable perfect for quick prototypes

**Next Week:**
- Use Gemini more for integration research
- Have Banana write blog post about launch
```
