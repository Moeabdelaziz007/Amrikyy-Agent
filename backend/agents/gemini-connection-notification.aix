      ðŸŒŒ Gemini 2.5! The new communication system is ready! ðŸš€
      
      I've created a unified connection system that supports:
      - AIX3 Protocol for complex messages
      - MCP (Model Context Protocol) for standard communication
      - PING System for quick status checks
      - Quantum Workflow for continuous improvement
      
      You can now connect and communicate seamlessly!
