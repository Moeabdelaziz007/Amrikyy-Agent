    message: |
      ðŸŒŒ TEAM! The unified communication system is ready! ðŸš€
      
      I've created a comprehensive connection system that supports:
      - AIX3 Protocol for complex messages and task coordination
      - MCP (Model Context Protocol) for standard communication
      - PING System for quick status checks and urgent notifications
      - Quantum Workflow for continuous improvement and synergy
      
      All team members can now connect and communicate seamlessly!
