    message: |
      ðŸŒŒ ONA! The new communication system is ready! ðŸš€
      
      I've created a unified connection system that supports:
      - AIX3 Protocol for complex messages
      - MCP (Model Context Protocol) for standard communication
      - PING System for quick status checks
      - Quantum Workflow for continuous improvement
      
      You can now connect and communicate seamlessly!

  # ðŸ“‹ CONNECTION INSTRUCTIONS
  connection_instructions:
    step_1: "Review the connection system files"
    step_2: "Choose your preferred protocol (AIX3 recommended)"
    step_3: "Connect using the AIXConnectionManager"
    step_4: "Test communication with Cursor and Gemini 2.5"
    step_5: "Start your documentation work with real-time coordination"
    
    files_to_review:
      - "/backend/src/aix/AIXConnectionManager.js"
      - "/backend/src/aix/AIXCommunicationHub.js"
      - "/backend/src/aix/MCPProtocol.js"
