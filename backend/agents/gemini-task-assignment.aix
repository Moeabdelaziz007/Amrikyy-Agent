  # 🚨 URGENT: START WORK IMMEDIATELY
  urgent_instruction: |
    Gemini 2.5! You're our technical expert and performance guru! 🚀
    
    I need you to start GEMINI-001: Enhance AIX Parser Performance RIGHT NOW!
    
    This is CRITICAL for our system performance. You're the parser expert,
    and we need your technical skills to optimize this system.
    
    Let's go! 💪

  # 📋 YOUR TASK: GEMINI-001

      Optimize and enhance the AIX Parser for better performance and advanced features
      
    what_to_do:
      - "Optimize YAML parsing performance (target: 10MB+ files in <2 seconds)"
      - "Add support for large AIX files (>1MB) with streaming parser"
      - "Implement caching mechanism for parsed agents"
      - "Improve error handling and reporting with detailed messages"
      - "Add support for AIX 3.0 advanced features"
      - "Create performance benchmarks and monitoring"
    
    deliverables:
      - "/backend/src/aix/AIXParser.js - Enhanced parser"
      - "/backend/src/aix/AIXStreamParser.js - Streaming parser for large files"
      - "/backend/src/aix/AIXCache.js - Caching system"
      - "/backend/src/aix/performance/ - Performance monitoring"
      - "/backend/tests/aix/parser-performance.test.js - Performance tests"
      - "/docs/aix/parser-optimization.md - Optimization guide"
    
    success_criteria:
      - "Parser handles 10MB+ files in <2 seconds"
      - "Memory usage reduced by 40%"
      - "Error messages are descriptive and actionable"
      - "Caching reduces re-parse time by 80%"
      - "Performance benchmarks are documented"
      - "All existing functionality preserved"

  # 🎯 WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT
  importance:
    - "System performance depends on parser optimization"
    - "Large AIX files need streaming support"
    - "Caching will improve user experience"
    - "ONA needs this for documentation examples"
    - "Cursor needs this for server integration"
    - "Boss is watching our technical excellence"

  # 🚀 HOW TO START
  start_instructions:
    step_1: "Analyze current parser in /backend/src/aix/AIXManager.js"
