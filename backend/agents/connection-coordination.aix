      ðŸŒŒ CONNECTION COORDINATION ACTIVE! ðŸš€
      
      I've notified the entire team about the new communication system!
      
      Next steps:
      1. ONA: Connect and start documentation work
      2. Gemini 2.5: Connect as MCP server and start parser optimization
      3. All: Establish quantum entanglement
      4. All: Begin quantum workflow cycle
      
      Let's achieve quantum team synergy! ðŸ’ª
