   ```javascript
   // Improved implementation
   async function handleAIRequest(req, res) {
     try {
       const validatedInput = validateAIRequest(req.body);
       const aiResponse = await generateAIResponse(validatedInput);
       const formattedResponse = formatAIResponse(aiResponse);
       return res.json(formattedResponse);
     } catch (error) {
       handleAIError(error, res);
     }
   }
   
   function validateAIRequest(body) {
     // Validation logic
   }
   
   async function generateAIResponse(input) {
     // AI generation logic
   }
   
   function formatAIResponse(response) {
     // Formatting logic
   }

    * @route POST /api/payment/create
    */
   router.post('/create',
     // Input validation
     [
       body('amount').isNumeric().withMessage('Amount must be a number'),
       body('currency').isIn(['USD', 'EUR', 'SAR']).withMessage('Invalid currency'),
       body('userId').isUUID().withMessage('Invalid user ID')
     ],
     async (req, res) => {
       try {
         // Validate input
         const errors = validationResult(req);
         if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
           return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
         }
   
         const { amount, currency, userId } = req.body;
   
         // Use parameterized query (prevents SQL injection)
         const { data, error } = await db
           .from('payments')
           .insert({
             amount,
             currency,
             user_id: userId,

         if (error) {
           throw error;
         }
   
         res.json({
           success: true,
           payment: data
         });
       } catch (error) {
         console.error('Payment creation error:', error);
         res.status(500).json({
           success: false,
           message: 'Failed to create payment'
         });
       }
     }
   );
   
   module.exports = router;
   ```
   
   **Test:**
   ```javascript
   // backend/tests/payment.test.js
   const request = require('supertest');
   const app = require('../server');
   
   describe('POST /api/payment/create', () => {
     it('should create payment with valid input', async () => {
       const response = await request(app)
         .post('/api/payment/create')
         .send({
           amount: 100,
           currency: 'USD',
           userId: 'valid-uuid-here'
         });
       
       expect(response.status).toBe(200);
       expect(response.body.success).toBe(true);
     });
     
     it('should reject invalid amount', async () => {
       const response = await request(app)
         .post('/api/payment/create')
         .send({
           amount: 'invalid',
           currency: 'USD',
           userId: 'valid-uuid-here'
         });
       
       expect(response.status).toBe(400);
     });
   });
   ```
