# Bug Report: Multiple Linting Issues in Backend

**Severity:** High
**Assigned to:** Cursor

## Description

During a routine workspace scan, the `npm run lint` command revealed 267 problems (85 errors, 182 warnings) in the `backend` workspace. These issues impact code quality, readability, and may hide potential bugs.

## Details

The issues are spread across multiple files. Here is a summary of the most critical problems:

### 1. `backend/src/agents/mini-aladdin.js`
- **Multiple `comma-dangle` errors:** Unexpected trailing commas in function arguments and object literals.
- **Multiple `quotes` errors:** Strings are not using single quotes consistently.

### 2. `backend/src/monitoring/metrics.js`
- **Multiple `no-undef` errors:** Several variables (`redisCacheHits`, `redisCacheMisses`, etc.) are used without being defined. This will cause runtime errors.

### 3. `backend/routes/admin-dashboard.js`
- **`no-case-declarations` error:** A lexical declaration was found in a `case` block without being enclosed in a block.

### 4. `backend/src/routes/aladdin.js`
- **`indent` errors:** Incorrect indentation.

### 5. `backend/src/services/redis-service.js`
- **`no-useless-catch` error:** A `try...catch` block is catching an error and immediately re-throwing it, which is redundant.

### 6. Widespread `no-unused-vars` warnings
- Many files contain variables that are declared but never used. While not errors, they contribute to code clutter and should be removed.

## Action Required

Cursor needs to:
1. Run `npm run lint:fix` in the `backend` directory to automatically fix the 68 fixable errors.
2. Manually address the remaining errors, especially the `no-undef` errors in `metrics.js` as they are critical.
3. Review and fix the `comma-dangle`, `quotes`, and other errors in `mini-aladdin.js` and other files.
4. Remove all unused variables.

A clean lint is essential for maintaining a healthy codebase.
