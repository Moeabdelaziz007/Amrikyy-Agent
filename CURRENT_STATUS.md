## 🎯 Smart Frontend Strategy with Kombai

### Why Kombai?

```
Traditional Approach:
😰 Manually code 50+ components
😰 CSS styling for hours
😰 Responsive design headaches
😰 2-3 weeks of UI work

Kombai Approach:
😎 Design in Figma (1 day)
😎 Kombai converts to React (instant)
😎 Connect APIs (1-2 days)
😎 Total: 2-3 days! ⚡
```

### What I'll Do vs Kombai

**Kombai Generates:**

- ✨ AgentDNA Builder UI (sliders, forms)
- ✨ izi.TRAVEL Browser (cards, search)
- ✨ Payment checkout UI
- ✨ Dashboard layouts
- ✨ All styling (Tailwind CSS)

**I Connect:**

- 🔌 API calls to backend
- 🔌 State management (React Query)
- 🔌 Form validation
- 🔌 Loading states
- 🔌 Error handling

### Phase 3: API Integration (Me - 1-2 days)

```typescript
// Example: Connect AgentDNA Builder

import { agentDNAService } from '../services/agentDNAService';
import { useState } from 'react';

function AgentDNABuilder() {
  const [agent, setAgent] = useState({
    personality: { analytical: 50, ... },
    skills: { coding: 50, ... },
    behavior: { decisionSpeed: 50, ... }
  });

  const handleCreate = async () => {
    const created = await agentDNAService.createAgent(agent);
    console.log('Agent created:', created);
  };

  // Kombai-generated UI here
  return <KombaiGeneratedComponent data={agent} onChange={setAgent} />;
}
