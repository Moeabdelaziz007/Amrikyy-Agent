# ⚠️ VERCEL MANUAL FIX REQUIRED

**Status**: 🔴 Build Failed  
**Reason**: Wrong branch configuration  
**Action**: Manual fix needed in Vercel Dashboard

---

## 🔴 Problem Summary

Vercel is configured to build from an **old branch** instead of `main`:

```
❌ Current: copilot/vscode1761152273359 (deleted)
✅ Should be: main
```

This causes build failures because the old branch has outdated code.

---

## ✅ SOLUTION (5 minutes)

### **Step 1: Open Vercel Dashboard**
Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard

### **Step 2: Select Your Project**
Click on: `frontend` project

### **Step 3: Go to Settings**
Click on: **Settings** tab (top navigation)

### **Step 4: Find Git Section**
Scroll down to: **Git** section

### **Step 5: Change Production Branch**
Look for: **Production Branch**  
Current value: `copilot/vscode1761152273359`  
Change to: `main`  
Click: **Save**

### **Step 6: Trigger New Deployment**
1. Go to: **Deployments** tab
2. Click: **Redeploy** button (on latest deployment)
3. Select: **Use existing Build Cache: No** ✅
4. Click: **Redeploy**

---

## 📊 What Will Happen

After changing to `main` branch:

```
✅ Vercel will clone from: main branch
✅ Latest commit: 2a7893a (with new UI)
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ Build will succeed
✅ New UI will deploy
```

---

## 🔍 How to Verify

### **Before Fix**
```
Branch: copilot/vscode1761152273359
Commit: c8304f2
Status: ❌ Failed
Error: TypeScript errors in aiDesktopMockData.ts
```

### **After Fix**
```
Branch: main
Commit: 2a7893a (or later)
Status: ✅ Success
Result: New Kombai UI deployed
```

---

## 📝 Alternative: Vercel CLI

If you prefer command line:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Go to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Deploy from main branch
vercel --prod --force

# This will use current branch (main)
```

---

## 🎯 Expected Timeline

```
1. Change branch in settings: 1 min
2. Trigger redeploy: 30 sec
3. Build process: 2-3 min
4. Deployment: 1 min
---
Total: ~5 minutes
```

---

## ✅ Success Checklist

- [ ] Vercel settings show: Production Branch = `main`
- [ ] New deployment triggered

## 💡 Why This Happened

1. Multiple copilot branches were created during development
2. Vercel auto-detected one of these branches
3. That branch became the default production branch
4. We need to manually change it back to `main`

---

## 🚨 IMPORTANT

**DO THIS NOW** to get your new UI deployed:

1. Open Vercel Dashboard
2. Change Production Branch to `main`
3. Redeploy

**Time Required**: 5 minutes  
**Difficulty**: Easy (just click a few buttons)
