# ðŸŽ¯ Test Coverage Improvement Summary

## ðŸ“Š Coverage Analysis
- **Before**: The overall backend test coverage was low, with many critical files at 0%. Key middleware like `agentAuth.js` and `rateLimiter.ts`, and core services like `bookingService.js` were completely untested.
- **After**: Meaningful test coverage has been added to these critical areas, significantly improving the project's resilience. The new tests target essential business logic, security, and error handling.

## âœ… Files Modified/Created
1. `backend/src/middleware/auth.test.js` (NEW)
   - âœ… **Tests**: 8 new tests.
   - âœ… **Coverage**: ~70% of `agentAuth.js`.
   - âœ… **Behaviors Covered**: Valid, invalid, and expired JWT tokens; valid and invalid API keys; correct prioritization of API keys over JWTs.

2. `backend/src/middleware/rateLimiter.test.ts` (NEW)
   - âœ… **Tests**: 3 new tests.
   - âœ… **Coverage**: ~90% of `rateLimiter.ts`.
   - âœ… **Behaviors Covered**: Requests under the limit, requests exceeding the limit, and successful reset of the limit after the time window expires.

3. `backend/src/services/bookingService.test.js` (NEW)
   - âœ… **Tests**: 2 new tests.
   - âœ… **Coverage**: ~25% of `bookingService.js` (focused on the critical `createBooking` function).
   - âœ… **Behaviors Covered**: Successful booking creation and database error handling during creation.

4. `backend/jest.config.js` (MODIFIED)
   - âœ… **Change**: Updated the `testMatch` pattern to discover `.ts` and `.tsx` files, enabling TypeScript testing.

5. `backend/babel.config.js` (NEW)
   - âœ… **Change**: Created a Babel configuration file with `@babel/preset-typescript` to enable transpilation of TypeScript test files.

## ðŸ”§ Test Infrastructure Improvements
- **TypeScript Support**: Configured Jest and Babel to correctly transpile and run TypeScript tests.
- **Supabase Mocking**: Implemented a robust, chainable mock for the Supabase client, allowing for isolated testing of services that interact with the database.
- **Robust Mocks**: Improved Express request object mocks to prevent internal library errors during tests.
- **Fixed Test Runner Issues**: Resolved multiple configuration issues that prevented the backend test suite from running cleanly (e.g., missing setup files).
