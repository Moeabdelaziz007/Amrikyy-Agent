  }
}
```

**AIX 3.0 Format (NEW - Natural Language):**
```
🤔 CURSOR TO ONA:

Quick question about Task 1.2.1 (Dynamic Coordination)...

The implementation guide mentions semantic vectors for agent matching.
Which embedding model should I use?

Options:
1. text-embedding-3-large (768-dim, most accurate)
2. text-embedding-3-small (512-dim, faster)
3. Local model (free, but slower)

I'm leaning towards #1 for accuracy, but wanted to check if we have 
budget concerns or performance requirements I should know about.

Not urgent - just want to start with the right approach! 👍
```

**Test Result:** ✅ PASS
- **Clarity:** 10/10 (question is clear)
- **Context:** 10/10 (provides reasoning)
- **Options:** 10/10 (well explained)
- **Tone:** 10/10 (collaborative, not demanding)

  }
}
```

**AIX 3.0 Format (NEW - Natural Language):**
```
✅ ONA TO CURSOR:

Great question! Go with text-embedding-3-large (768-dim).

Why:
- Accuracy is our priority for AIX 3.0
- Budget is fine (Boss wants best quality)
- Performance is acceptable (10-50ms is great)
- Future-proof (industry standard)

You were right to lean towards #1! Trust your instincts 💪

Start coding - you're cleared to proceed! 🚀
```

**Test Result:** ✅ PASS

    "urgency": "address_before_production"
  }
}
```

**AIX 3.0 Format (NEW - Natural Language):**
```
🚨 GEMINI SECURITY ALERT:

Found a potential security issue with vector embeddings!

Issue: Data Poisoning Risk
Location: Semantic vector generation
Severity: HIGH

What could happen:
Malicious actors could inject crafted vectors that look legitimate
but cause agents to trust bad data or make wrong decisions.

Impact:
- Agents might collaborate with compromised agents
- Trust scores could be manipulated
- System integrity at risk

Recommendation:
Add SHA-256 checksum validation for all vectors
(Already in AIX 3.0 spec - just make sure we implement it!)

@Cursor - When you build the vector system, include checksum validation
@Ona - Should we add this to the security checklist?

Not blocking current work, but let's address before production! 🔒
```

**Test Result:** ✅ PASS
- **Urgency:** 10/10 (clear but not panicked)
- **Explanation:** 10/10 (technical but understandable)
- **Impact:** 10/10 (explains consequences)
- **Solution:** 10/10 (actionable recommendation)

```
👀 CURSOR TO GEMINI:

Just finished the first draft of dynamic-coordinator.js (156 lines).

Can you review when you have time? Specifically looking for:
- Async handling (lots of promises, want to make sure I'm not missing awaits)
- Error handling (tried to be thorough but might have gaps)
- Performance (any obvious bottlenecks?)

No rush - just want a second pair of eyes before I commit! 

File: backend/src/coordination/dynamic-coordinator.js

Thanks! 🙏

```

**AIX 3.0 Format (NEW - Natural Language):**
```
✅ GEMINI TO CURSOR:

Reviewed dynamic-coordinator.js - looks GREAT overall! 👏

Code Quality: 8.5/10 (really solid work!)

Found a few things to improve:

🟡 Medium Priority:
1. Line 42: Missing error handling in assignTask()
   → Add try-catch block around the agent lookup
   
2. Line 89: Potential race condition in rebalance()
   → Add mutex lock when redistributing tasks

🟢 Low Priority (nice-to-haves):
3. Line 23: Could extract this logic into a helper function
4. Line 67: Consider adding a comment explaining the algorithm
5. Line 134: Typo in variable name (agnet → agent)

Overall: This is production-ready with those 2 medium fixes! 🚀

Want me to write the tests while you fix these? We can ship faster that way!
```

**Test Result:** ✅ PASS
- **Feedback:** 10/10 (constructive and specific)
- **Prioritization:** 10/10 (clear severity levels)
- **Encouragement:** 10/10 (celebrates good work)
- **Collaboration:** 10/10 (offers to help)
