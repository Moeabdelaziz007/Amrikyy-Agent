## üí° ONA'S NOTES

**Boss's directive interpretation:**
- "Update them" = Post clear questions with deadlines
- "Always check" = Monitor every 15 minutes
- "Keep in touch" = Active communication, not passive waiting
- "Finish with them" = Push until implementation starts

**My commitment:**
- No passive waiting
- Active coordination every 15 minutes
- Immediate unblocking
- Push to completion
